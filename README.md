# README: Assignment Instructions

## Before you start:

Go to [`_quarto.yml`](_quarto.yml) and fill in your name. 
This will ensure that all documents in this project have your name on them.

## Rules for this assignment:

- You must write your own code for this assignment. You may work with other students and discuss the problem and how to solve it, but your code must be written individually.

- You may use generative AI on this assignment, but any prompt/script must be saved and turned in with the assignment. You must also be able to explain every line of code you submit, whether or not you used AI to write it.




## Assignment Process

You will have 3 weeks to complete the steps of this assignment.

1. [`pseudocode.qmd`](pseudocode.qmd) - you will design pseudocode to play and summarize one or more games of craps, with some help from generative AI.

2. [`craps-code.qmd`](craps-code.qmd) - you will write code (using any language taught in this class) to implement the simulated game of craps using the pseudocode created in the first week.

3. [`simulation.qmd`](simulation.qmd) - you will write code to answer a complex probability question using your craps code from week 2.


I will grade `pseudocode.qmd` after the first week, `craps-code.qmd` after the second week, and `simulation.qmd` after the end of third week.
Your assignment will be graded on the progress in your github repository at the end of each week, so please make sure you push your code after each significant modification.




## Grading Schema

- The pseudocode for this assignment is worth one homework grade.

- The code for the game of craps is worth a second homework grade.

- The simulation results using the code in the previous assignment is worth a 3rd homework grade.
